## Hi there 👋
I'm a 👨‍💻 Back-End Web Developer with over 9+ years of experience, specializing in PHP and Laravel. I’ve built secure, scalable web applications and designed 🔗 RESTful APIs, with strong skills in 🗄️ MySQL and MongoDB. I’m experienced in implementing 🔒 authentication systems and integrating 🔌 third-party services. With a good grasp of 🎨 HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Angular, I collaborate smoothly with front-end teams. I’m also familiar with 🐳 Docker, 🔁 CI/CD pipelines, and 🖥️ server management as part of my DevOps workflow.
